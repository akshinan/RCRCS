		<h2>The Royal College First Aid Unit</h2>

<p>The Royal College First Aid Initiative stands as a testament to the enduring dedication of the Royal College Red Cross Society (RCRCS) towards the safety and well-being of our school community. Since its inception in 1978, this initiative has woven itself into the very fabric of our school's identity. Over the years, our mission to champion first aid preparedness and response has seen remarkable progress, making significant strides in the realm of health and safety. As we look back on the profound impact we’ve achieved, we also eagerly anticipate the exciting opportunities that lie ahead with the second phase of our project.</p>

<p>This new phase will introduce the Preliminary Care Unit, where members will undergo rigorous training and testing, both written and practical, to ensure they are thoroughly prepared to handle first aid situations. Our goals are clear and vital: to ensure the safety of every Royalist, cultivate a well-disciplined and well-trained first aid squad, reduce accidents within the school, and equip the college with competent first aiders and leaders. Furthermore, we aim to educate our students, teachers, and staff about first aid precautions for common medical emergencies, creating a healthier and safer environment throughout Royal College.</p>

<h2> 45th Annual Blood Donation Campaign</h2>

<p>Since 1979, the Royal College Red Cross Society’s Annual Blood Donation Campaign has been a cornerstone of our tradition and a major event not just for the school but for the entire nation. Last year, in its 44th iteration, the campaign was held in six locations, underscoring our commitment to supporting the National Blood Bank and, by extension, the entire country. This year, we aspire to build on that legacy with the 45th Annual Blood Donation Campaign. We plan to organize four donation drives in diverse locations across the country—Anuradhapura Padaviya Base Hospital, Hambantota District General Hospital, Trinity College in Kandy, and Royal College in Colombo 07.</p>

<p>Our primary objectives are to address the critical shortage of blood resources in the National Blood Bank, spread awareness about the importance of blood donation, and support Sri Lanka’s healthcare system by providing safe, clinically approved blood. By reaching out to different regions, we aim to maximize donor participation and reinforce the spirit of community and generosity that has always been the hallmark of our campaign.</p>

<h2>Vision ’24</h2>

<p>Vision '24 continues the noble tradition of the Royal College Red Cross Society in promoting eye donation and eye care. With roots tracing back to 1979, this project was the first school initiative of its kind in Sri Lanka, highlighting our long-standing commitment to community welfare. In collaboration with the National Eye Hospital of Sri Lanka, Vision '24 seeks to register a significant number of eye donors for the National Eye Bank, contributing to the fight against blindness.</p>

<p>This year, we are expanding our reach by partnering with St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. Together, we will conduct eye checkups and donation campaigns in rural areas, aiming to provide access to modern medical facilities to underserved communities. Scheduled for September and October, the campaign will take place in Hambantota, Royal College, and St. Thomas College. Our objectives are to register as many eye donors as possible, raise awareness about the importance of eye donations, and encourage other schools to join this crucial cause, thereby making Vision a perennial project of the Red Cross Society.</p>

<h2> Health First’24</h2>

<p>Health First'24 is a comprehensive initiative of the Royal College Red Cross Society aimed at enhancing community health and safety. The project is divided into two distinct phases. The first phase focuses on establishing a detailed database to document all first aid interventions by our members, providing valuable insights into our emergency response efforts and areas for improvement.</p>

<p>The second phase involves the creation and dissemination of educational e-books covering a range of topics, from first aid techniques for sports injuries to workout programs. These resources are designed to empower individuals with the knowledge and skills to handle emergencies and maintain health and safety. This year, Health First will also feature the return of the "Chronicles" initiative, a club magazine highlighting the history of RCRCS, first aid, sports injuries, and humanitarian laws. Additionally, we will publish "Transform," a magazine offering workout programs, and "Knowledge College 2024," a series of first aid banners and educational videos on International Humanitarian Laws, developed in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program and the WHO.</p>

<h2> Infusion ’24</h2>

<p>Infusion '24 represents a series of community service projects that build on the successful foundation laid in 2020 at the Vajira Sri Children's Development Center. This year, Infusion aims to expand significantly, with a range of initiatives meticulously planned to make a tangible difference in the community, spanning from educational outreach to healthcare support.</p>

<p>In April, Humanity’24 will distribute dry food rations to those in need during the Aurudu season, in collaboration with the Leo Club of Royal College. Following that, May will see the College Restoration and Renovation Project, focusing on renovating the Red Cross Room and SDS at Royal College. June will bring two significant efforts: Heart and Soul, a partnership with the UNESCO Club to donate to the National Cancer Hospital, and Brave Hearts, which supports injured war veterans through donations and interactive sessions at Mihindu Seth Medura. In July, the Rajasisugama Project will collaborate with the Globe Family of Royal College to provide a donation and lecture session focused on the history of Rajasisugama and Royal College.</p>

<p>These initiatives not only provide essential resources and support to various community groups but also promote mental health, first aid training, healthcare access, and awareness.</p>

<h2> First Aid Leadership Training Program</h2>

<p>The First Aid Leadership Training Program underscores the critical importance of immediate assistance during emergencies. Recognizing that prompt and effective first aid can save lives, prevent further harm, and facilitate recovery, the Royal College Red Cross Society has organized a series of workshops to equip participants with essential first aid skills. </p>

<p>In collaboration with the Royal College Doctors' Association, the Sri Lanka Red Cross, and the Colombo Fire Service Department, these workshops will cover four main areas: basic first aid, CPR training, disaster management, and fire prevention. Scheduled for various dates from March to June at the MAS Arena and other venues, these sessions aim to build a community of confident first responders. By providing practical training and theoretical understanding, we hope to foster a sense of responsibility and leadership among the participants, empowering them to take charge during critical situations and contribute to the overall healthcare system in Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2> Project Orange Elephant</h2>

<p>Project Orange Elephant is an innovative initiative by the Royal College Red Cross Society aimed at mitigating human-elephant conflicts in Sri Lanka. This project employs a novel approach by planting citrus trees as natural barriers around farmlands, deterring elephants from encroaching on crops and providing farmers with an additional income source from the sale of citrus fruits.</p>

<p>Set to take place in August in Wasgamuwa, the project aims to protect agricultural produce, enhance farmers' livelihoods, and promote the coexistence of humans and wildlife. Through workshops and outreach programs, we also seek to raise awareness about the importance of elephant conservation and biodiversity. Project Orange Elephant is a significant step towards sustainable conservation, ensuring a balanced relationship between communities and wildlife while supporting rural economies.</p>

<h2> Alleviate ’24</h2>

<p>Alleviate '24 is a major fundraiser organized by the Royal College Red Cross Society, set to take place in November at the Royal College Junior Ground. This vibrant event, infused with the spirit of a music and food carnival, is designed to raise funds for community service projects. The event will feature performances by talented school-level artists and a diverse array of food and beverages, creating a festive and engaging atmosphere for all attendees.</p>

<p>The primary objective of Alleviate '24 is to generate funds to support various community service initiatives aligned with the fundamental principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. In addition to raising funds, the event aims to provide a platform for young talents to showcase their skills, improve mental health through entertainment, and create a memorable and meaningful experience for all participants.</p>
