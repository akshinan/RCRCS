<h2>41st Annual Blood Donation Campaign</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Annual Blood Donation Campaign is one of the major events organized by 
the Royal College Red Cross Society and it has become our tradition since 1979. 
This massive community service project is not for the school’s benefit alone, but 
in aid of the national blood bank and through it for the entire country. It was the 
41st Annual Blood Donation Campaign organized this year.</p>	
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have proudly continued this legacy and held the 41st Annual Blood 
Donation Campaign on the 25th of September 2020. We are an important 
supplier of Blood to the National Blood Bank over the years. This year we 
were able to collect 270 pints the second biggest ever blood donation 
organized by a school and the largest blood donation in Royal history 
breaking the record of 238 pints in 2016. And it is also considered as the 
biggest blood donation organized after the Corona pandemic while the 
National Blood Center having a severe shortage of blood. For this 
achievement we will be awarded on next year World Blood Donors’ Day 
celebration event organized by the National Blood Transfusion Service of Sri 
Lanka.</p>									  

<h2>Project Orange Elephant</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Orange Elephant (POE) is an initiative to 
minimize the human-elephant conflict prevailing in 
Sri Lanka in an environment-friendly manner as well 
as to provide rural villagers in Sri Lanka an extra 
source of income.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">POE got its name by the use of the Bibile Sweet 
Orange Plant which is the main resource for this 
project. As for prior scientific research and 
observations conducted by SLWLCS elephants by 
nature dislikes citrus plants due to their smell and 
thorns. Therefore, the Bibile Sweet Orange plant was selected, as it is both an 
endemic plant and it also emits an intense citrus smell. Besides the Bibile Sweet 
Orange plants takes only 2 years to mature and give the harvest. This orange 
harvest can bring extra income for the residents in the targeted regions.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">POE was first initiated by the Wild Life Conservation Society of Sri Lanka 
(SLWLCS). The Royal College Red Cross Society (RCRCS) joined hands with 
SLWLCS in 2018 in a campaign to raise awareness on the human-elephant 
conflict and also raise funds for POE which resulted in a very successful campaign 
resulting in a donation of 2000 Bibile Orange Plants to be planted in rural areas 
of Wasgamuwa.</p>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year as this 2nd phase of POE conducted by RCRCS we have decided to 
incorporate the help of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) and donated 500 
Bible Sweet Orange Plants to selected school/s of the areas suffering from 
human-elephant conflict. The plants have been planned to be purchased from 
the Agricultural department and will be supervised by an expert in the field of 
human-elephant conflict resolution Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya.</p>									  
								  
<h2>Chronicles</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the virus and the long lockdown that was 
experienced throughout the country, the students 
around Sri Lanka are in confusion as to what to do to 
stay safe from this deadly virus.  This is a project 
organized by the Royal College Red Cross Society who 
seeks to give a platform to all frontline workers, 
administrators, and policymakers, who are working 
hard to curb the novel Covid-19, a chance to share their 
experiences directly to students, depending on their 
expertise and what we can do to prevent it to keep our country safe.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">We also interviewed prominent businessmen and artists to share their 
thought and opinion on the current situation in the country. </p>

<h2>First Aid and Medical Coverage</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First Aid was provided for events throughout the year on a letter request made 
addressed to the Teacher in Charge of the Red Cross Society of Royal College. 
The Top Board Officials, Senior Committee members and the Lower Board and 
the members of the RCRCS engaged in these activities throughout the year. 
The Following events were provided with First Aid on request.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most prominent services provided by 
the Red Cross Society of Royal College. As the major 
first aid provider of the College, the Royal College Red 
Cross Society has pledged in its vision and mission to 
support every event of the College through the 
provision of First Aid. The society has provided First Aid 
in every major event of the College from its inception in 
1978. This year the Royal College Red Cross Society has 
been successful in providing First Aid in collaboration with the Doctors 
Association of Royal College to every event of the College which requested for 
First Aid in its best ability.</p>	

<h2>First Aid E-Book</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Royal College Red Cross Society with a great purpose of imparting in providing 
First Aid knowledge to the Society had the idea of publishing an eBook in both 
English and Sinhala languages including the day-to-day basic First Aid syllabus.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">We have published our First Aid guides on the Scribd website, a website for 
eBooks. Through this First Aid E-Book, the society hopes to provide a simple 
and understand First Aid knowledge to Students, Scouts, Sportsmen, Cadets, 
Teachers, etc. </p>	

<h2>Care4U</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Royal College Red Cross Society has launched a nation
wide chatbot service to answer all the questions about First 
aid and Coronavirus integrated with the popular chat 
service, Viber and Telegram. This chatbot provides first aid 
related information, coronavirus related information as 
well as helpful tips for handling physical and emotional 
health. There is a quiz to improve and get a guarantee about 
your First Aid knowledge </p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">Care 4 U is a project done by the grade 12 members of the Red Cross Society of 
Royal College. This is a bot dedicated to providing first aid and health-related 
facts to the community via social media platforms; Viber and Telegram. </p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">Viber is free to download app that allows users to make free calls, send texts, 
pictures and video messages to other Viber users. It works on both mobile and 
computer and can be used to connect with people around the world. As of 
February 2015, the messaging app claims 236 million active monthly users.</p>	
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Telegram is a cross-platform cloud-based instant messaging, video calling, and 
VoIP service. It was initially launched for iOS on 14 August 2013 in Russia and is 
currently based in Dubai. As of April 2020, Telegram had 400 million monthly 
active users.</p>	
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">This project will be a great service for the people in their day-to-day health
related needs. This will be the first time ever for a project of this kind to be 
implemented in Sri Lanka by any school. The answers to the questions will be 
automatically provided by the Viber Bot and anyone can use this service at any 
time, free of charge. It is more user friendly for the user to learn basic First Aid.</p>									  
								  
<h2>Restart a Heart</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Royal College Red Cross Society organized the Restart a Heart project in 
the month of January. The workshop was conducted by the College of 
Anesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka as a part of their program 
‘Restart a Heart’ Campaign organized to promote awareness regarding 
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">The program was conducted for the grade 12 students of the college and the 
members of the RCRCS to train students in CPR and provide them with the 
skills and confidence to act in an emergency situation to save a life.</p>

successfully.</p>	
								  
<h2>Our Hero’20</h2>								  

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the Quarantine period, everyone was finding it difficult to stay at home 
without being able to do anything interesting during the period. So the Royal

selves bored out of the beds and do something productive.</p>									  
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">“OurHero’20” Art competition was open to all schools and through this 
competition, competitors were able to exhibit their extravagant skills and effort.

<h2>Infusion'20</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">2020 has become a difficult year for the whole world because of the situation 
of Covid-19. This dreadful circumstance led us to the idea of the "Infusion'20" 
community service project. The project was organized by the junior members 
of the Royal College Red Cross Society.Infusion'20 project comprised a 
donation campaign for the orphan children in need at the Vajira Sri Children 
Development Centre and we also entertain children by arranging a good 
breakfast and some activities.The members of the society provided breakfast 
to the children at 7.30 a.m. And then they watched a movie. As per the request 
by the staff in the Development Centre Alarm clocks, IR Thermometer and A4 
sheets were donated by the members of the society. In addition to that 
Backpacks and toys were donated to all the children in the Centre.</p>	
								  
<h2>Nethrapuja</h2>								  
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">We collaborate with the Leo Club of Godigamuwa and The Rotaract Club of 
University Alumni for this project. As the current ongoing situation in the 
country, we couldn’t hold Eye Donation Campaigns as we did in the last 2 years. 
So, we are looking forward to doing our project using the Social Media 
platforms; Instagram and Facebook. Throughout two weeks as a challenge. The 
participants have to register to donate eyes and tissues, through the Sri Lanka 
Eye Donation Society website, then take a screenshot of the completed 
registration form and post it nominating 5 or more friends and tagging the 
official pages of Royal College Red Cross Society.</p>	
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the Royal College Red Cross Society, we find ourselves obliged to organize 
these projects and create opportunities to increase the donor base of the Sri 
Lanka Eye Donation Society as we have always done in the prestigious history of 
the Club. </p>								  							  

<h2>Epidemiology Quiz ’20</h2>

major events of the school to provide our members knowledge and practical 
experience regarding First Aid, thus intending to prepare them for attending and
