<h2>Brave Hearts</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Multiple Military Servicemen were injured during 30 Year Civil War in 
the country. They were not recognized after the war very much. As 
the Royal College Red Cross Society, we intend to show our gratitude 
towards them and to express the message they are not alone. “Brave 
Hearts” is a project where we do a donation programme to the 
Military Veterans who were injured during the Civil War. We hope to 
conduct a dinner night with the ex-military servicemen and to have a 
friendly discussion with them. Also, we are hoping to donate some dry 
rations and other supplies to the Centre as well as to the Individuals.</p>								  

<h2>Forza Medica’22</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the world progresses further, there has been an increase in 
problems the youth of our society face that have very little to no 
awareness on. These problems plague countries like Sri Lanka and 
most often than not, children and teenagers all over our will have to 
face these issues without understanding their effects and how to 
overcome them.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Royal College Red Cross Society plans on trying to minimize this 
issue by organizing “Forza Medica” to create awareness of these 
severe problems faced by the current generation that often get 
overlooked. For this project, we have planned to make four animation 
videos about the most common issues we could see among people in 
society. </p>							  
								  
<h2>Humanity</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A project recurring for the second time, “Humanity 2022” will be 
organized this year by the grade 10 batch of the Leo Club of Royal 
College and the Red Cross Society of Royal College. The project will 
take place in the first two weeks of April and will be centred around 
the Avurudu festival.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">Focusing on aiding those most in need, “Humanity 2022” is a 
community service project that will consist of two phases. The first 
phase is holding a miniature Avurudu festival celebration for the 
Hostellers of Royal College and the second phase is a donation 
distribution for beggars and daily wage workers in Colombo. </p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">This project hopes to contribute towards the benefit of our society 
and bring a sense of holiday and celebration into the lives of others. 
As two large community service clubs in Royal College, we’re 
confident the combined resources and planning between the Leo Club 
and the Red Cross Society will conclude this initiative successfully.</p>									  
								  
<h2>PCU (Preliminary Care Unit)</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Preliminary Care Unit is a well-trained unit of first aiders and leaders. 
By forming this unit, it will uphold the safety of the students at Royal 
College. The selected participants in 2021 will be sent to perform 
duties in every event at school to provide first aid coverage </p>		

<h2>43rd Blood Donation Campaign</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The annual Blood Donation Campaign is one of the major events 
organized by the Royal College Red Cross Society and it has become 
our tradition since 1979. This massive fund-raising project is not for 
the school’s benefit alone, but in aid of the national blood bank and 
through it for the entire country. Royal College Red Cross Society held 
the Blood Donation Campaign consecutively for the 42nd time last 
year. As the 43rd installment of this major event we are planning to 
do a better and record breaking one this time as well. This year we are 
planning to organize 5 Blood Donation Campaigns in 5 different 
locations in the country to maximize the donor count. </p>		

<h2>Medical Checkup</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The medical check up project will be a project done in collaboration 
with the Royal College Doctors Association. We together plan on 
organizing a medical check up in a rural area where there aren't 
enough facilities and where many people don't have a proper medical 
facilities. </p>	

<h2>Vision ’22</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Vision ’22 is an online eye donation campaign conducted by the Royal 
College Red Cross Society in association with the Sri Lanka Eye 
Donation Society intending to provide a maximum number of 
registered donors for the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society and thereby 
uplift the development process of Health care of the country by 
contributing to eradicate blindness.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">With the prevailing situation with the Covid - 19 pandemic in the 
country, the Eye Donation Campaign which was famous as one of the 
best physical community servicing projects, in 2020 for the first time 
in the Club’s history it got a new face of conducting the campaign via 
online platforms.</p>	

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the Royal College Red Cross Society, we find ourselves obliged to 
organize these projects and create opportunities to increase the 
donor base of the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society as we have always 
done in the prestigious history of the Club. Being the major First Aid 
provider as well as a prominent social service club of the College, we 
find it our responsibility to contribute in every possible way for the 
betterment of the health sector of the country.</p>									  									  

<h2>Transform’22</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Transform ‘22 is a project organized by the grade 10 students of the 
Royal College Red Cross Society. Physical activities have the ability to 
improve people's health and reduce the risk of developing several 
non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer, heart attack and 
much more. Physical activity and exercise can have immediate and 
long-term health benefits.</p>									  
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are conducting this project to improve physical fitness of the 
people in the society to lead a healthy and happy life free of diseases.  
The Transform held in the year 2021 was concluded successfully, it is 
still the most viewed video series up-to date within Instagram that had 
been released by Royal College with a 1000+ views per video. With the 
on-going fuel crisis, the Royal College Red Cross Society decided to 
encourage the use of bicycles as a mode of transport. The use of 
bicycles will also increase the physical fitness of students and people 
alike. We plan on making bicycles a viable mode of transport during 
these troubled times.</p>	
		
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year we're hoping to do the project bigger and better by holding 
it in 2 major phases. The first Phase will be a cycling track around 
Colombo in which anyone can join and cycle on the date, for the 
second phase of the project we will be constructing a bicycle shed in 
Royal College for students living near Colombo to come to school 
easier. </p>									  
								  
<h2>Alleviate'22</h2>
								  
						<div style="text-align: center;">			
<img src="images/alleviate (2).jpg" alt="Description of image" width="512" height="341">
	</div>								  
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alleviate is a fundraising project done in collaboration with the United 
Nations Club of Visakha Vidyalaya. We're hoping to organize a carnival 
filled with games and food and other entertainment items to raise 
funds as a source of income for the community service projects of our 
respective clubs.</p>									  	

<h2>Beach Cleanup</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Royal College Red Cross Society is organizing a beach cleanup to 
combat the issue of plastic waste harming nature and polluting the 
once proseperous beaches. We will be distributing tools and 
donations that will help clean the beaches. Sri Lanka being a tourist 
destincation due to its extraordinary beaches where people love to 
visit, it’s a shame to allow it to remain polluted. </p>									  

<h2>Knowledge College</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">First Aid is an essential skill that enables one to assist people who are 
injured in an event or emergency or accident until help arrives. 
Knowledge on basic first aid is important as the medical emergencies 
and accidents that are increasing at an alarming rate in the present 
world. Personal Safety has also become a vital life skill nowadays due 
to the present global pandemic situation. “Knowledge College” is a 
health promotion campaign organized by the Red Cross Society of 
Royal College to raise awareness about First Aid and Personal Safety 
within the school premises through printed media. </p>									  	

<h2>Infusion</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Infusion is a community service project organized by the Red Cross 
Society of Royal College. Infusion was done for the first time in 2020 
at Vajira Sri Children's Development Center. This project is done as a 
community service project that is suitable given the situation. This 
year too we will be conducting a community service project under 
Infusion. It will be conducted by the Grade 8 batch of the Red Cross 
Society</p>
