<h2>Forza Medica</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We organized “Forza Medica” to create awareness of non
communicable diseases in the society. For this project, we made five 
animation videos about the most common diseases we could see 
among people in the society. The chosen diseases were Cholesterol, 
Heart Attack, Diabetes, Hypertension and Respiratory Diseases. 
These videos create awareness about the causes of the diseases, 
ways to prevent them, symptoms and many more related facts 
about them. </p>									  

<h2>Glaring Days</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Glaring Days is the project we have organized to make people aware 
of international days that are less noticeable in the society with their 
busy work. We have chosen 29 international days to do our project. 
We will be sharing a graphic mentioning the importance of the day. </p>									  
								  
<h2>Calamity</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Calamity is a project which was organized to make people aware of 
natural disasters that might happen at any time unexpectedly. Natural 
disasters awareness is a very important part in reducing the damage 
of natural disasters. Disasters disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives 
every year. Each disaster has lasting effects, both to people and 
property. Creating awareness on natural disasters reduces the impact 
of disasters and sometimes it can avoid the danger completely by 
taking necessary steps needed. A guest speaker from Disaster 
Management Centre provided a knowledgeable lecture which 
included about floods, landslides, tsunamis, tornados, volcanic 
eruptions, storms and earthquakes which are considered as major 
natural disasters. </p>		

<h2>Transform</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Transform'21 is a project organized by the grade 9 students of Red 
Cross Society of Royal College. Physical activities can improve person’s 
health and reduce the risk of developing several non-communicable 
diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart attack. Physical activity and 
exercise can have immediate and long-term health benefits. We are 
conducting this project to improve physical fitness of the people in the 
society. </p>		

<h2>Chronicles</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Amidst the Covid-19 virus, the situation in our little island is in its 
worst state yet. With thousands of cases a day, several individuals 
are combatting the virus in effort to contain it. In the previous season 
of Chronicles, we spoke on awareness and containment but this year, 
for season two, the Royal College Red Cross Society is approaching a 
different prospect. We’ll be talking with individuals who are at the 
front line about the current situation of the virus, be it the bad, or 
the good. From conversations with some Sri Lanka’s most influential 
individuals, to awareness on our current situation, both the good, the 
bad and the silver-lining in between. Chronicles ’21 will combat the 
issue of miscommunication and lack of information. </p>	

<h2>Annual First Aid Workshop</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Annual First Aid Workshop is a project done by the Royal College 
Red Cross Society annually to broaden the knowledge regarding First 
Aid. First Aid knowledge is invaluable for both the individuals and for 
the community. It enables to assist persons who become injured in an 
accident or emergency until help arrives. Knowledge of first aid 
promotes the sense of safety and well-being amongst people, 
prompting them to be more alert and safer in the surroundings they 
dwell in. Awareness and desire to be accident-free keep people more 
safe and secure, reducing the number of causalities and accidents. We 
hope to provide the participants with the quintessential knowledge 
they need and to provide them with the knowledge regarding basic 
medical procedures by this project. And also, as the 2nd session of the 
project, we will be doing a graphic campaign through social Media 
regarding First Aid. This event will be carrying out with the 
collaboration of the Royal College Doctors’ Association. </p>	

<h2>Break the Outbreak</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Break the Outbreak is a quiz competition organized by the Grade 11 
members of the Royal College Red Cross Society. As of the current 
pandemic situation everyone is stuck at home and we are conducting 
this project to uplift people’s mental health and also uplifting the 
people’s knowledge about Covid-19 pandemic. The top 5 winners of 
this competition will be rewarded with a prize. </p>	
						  
<h2>PCU (Preliminary Care Unit)</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preliminary Care Unit is a well-trained unit of first aiders and leaders. 
By forming this unit, it will uphold the safety of the students at Royal 
College. We will be holding 3 lectures about basic first aid knowledge 
for the first aiders with the cooperation of the Royal College Doctors’ 
Association. After the 3 lectures there will be a written test for all the 
applicants. The top 30 performers in that test will be selected for this 
unit. We have conducted this project since 2017 and we are looking 
forward to continue this great service to the college this year as well.</p>									  
						  
<h2>PCU Leadership Programme</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>									  

<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>									  
						  
<h2></h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">PCU Leadership programme is organized by Royal College Red Cross 
Society to our members who will be choosing to the Preliminery Care 
Unit. Leadership development programmes give people important 
leadership skills and attributes they need to be an effective leader, 
such as communication skills, motivation and inspiration, as well as 
better decision-making skills and accountability. As a part of the 
process of initiating the “Preliminary Care Unit” we organized a 
leadership programme for the selected PCU members focused on 
developing their situational leadership skills. The programme was 
conducted in a very friendly and simple manner which was really 
useful to the members and which was really easy to understand.</p>									  
						  
<h2>LifeGuard</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">LifeGuard project is organized by the Royal College Red Cross Society 
to keep people knowledgeable about First Aid and steps to be taken 
in emergencies. Knowledge of first aid promotes the sense of safety 
and wellbeing amongst people, prompting them to be more alert and 
safe in the surroundings they dwell in. A wrong step in first aid can 
lead worst results which can be even dangerous. It’s always beneficial 
to anyone to know the right first aid and the right steps to follow in an 
emergency. To provide knowledge about First Aid and steps to be 
taken in emergencies among people we are looking forward to 
developing an app. Our app will be available in both Play Store and 
App Store to make it more convenient to people.</p>									  
						  
<h2>E-Book Sports Edition</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Royal College Red Cross Society to impart in providing sports 
injury First Aid, we will be publishing an E-Book. Through this 
E-Book we hope to provide a simple and understandable E
Book for the players and coaches.</p>									  
						  
<h2>Infusion</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project Hope ’21 will be a day out event for the kids from an 
orphanage to build their mindset. We have mainly focused on this 
project more as a charity event to make kids feel better and motivate 
them by planning events to build up team spirit and leadership along 
with fun. As of the current Covid-19 situation we are planning to 
conduct this project virtually.</p>									  
						  
<h2>Lecture Series</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lectures retain a major educational role because they exploit evolved 
aspects of human nature to make learning easy and more effective. In 
collaboration with the Royal College Non-Addict Movement and the 
UNESCO Club of Royal College, we are planning to conduct 5-10 
lectures which are nowadays need to make aware. It will be a weekly 
lecture series and will be conducted by professionals in the relevant 
fields.</p>									  
						  
<h2>42nd Blood Donation Campaign</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Annual Blood Donation Campaign is one of the major events 
organized by the Royal College Red Cross Society and it has become 
our tradition since 1979. This massive community service project is 
not for the school’s benefit alone, but in aid of the National Blood Bank 
and through it for the entire country. We are organizing the 42nd Blood 
Donation Campaign, this year.</p>									  
						  
<h2>Knowledge College</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">First Aid is an essential skill that enables one to assist people who are 
injured in an event or emergency or accident until help arrives. 
Knowledge on basic first aid is important as the medical emergencies 
and accidents that are increasing at an alarming rate in the present 
world. Personal Safety has also become a vital life skill nowadays due 
to the present global pandemic situation. “Knowledge College” is a 
health promotion campaign organized by the Red Cross Society of 
Royal College to raise awareness about First Aid and Personal Safety 
within the school premises through printed media.</p>									  
								  
<h2>Vision ’21</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are planning to continue our Eye Donation Campaign for the 4th 
consecutive time this year. This will be a great opportunity not only 
for the students but also for any citizen who will be willing to donate 
their eyes.</p>									  
								  
<h2>Revival</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though safe water is essential for human life, there are many 
schools across the country which are less facilitated. Revival is a 
project organized by the Royal College Red Cross Society that creates 
an initiative to provide clean drinking water. For this project we would 
be collaborating with a supply company and we will be setting up taps 
with a water purifiers in it, across locations in school that do not have 
clean drinking water.</p>									  
								  
<h2>The Health Magazine</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Health Magazine is a publication which will be published by the 
Royal College Red Cross Society. And also it is the first Health 
Magazine to be published in the College History. Being healthy should 
be part of everyone’s overall lifestyle. Living a healthy lifestyle can 
help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. It will include 
Health Tips, Health related articles from doctors, Articles from the 
members of the Royal College Red Cross Society and many more 
important information.</p>									  
										  
<h2>Coast to Coast</h2>
								  
<p style="text-align: justify;">In collaboration with the LEO Club of Royal College, “Beach Cleanup” 
is an initiative created to combat the issue of plastic waste harming 
nature and polluting the once prosperous beaches. We will be 
distributing tools and donations that will help clean the beaches. Sri 
Lanka being a tourist destination one to its extraordinary where 
people love to visit, it’s ashame to allow it to remain polluted.</p>
